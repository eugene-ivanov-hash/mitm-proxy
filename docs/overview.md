# MITM Proxy Overview

## Introduction

MITM Proxy is a powerful Man-In-The-Middle proxy utility that allows intercepting, inspecting, and modifying HTTP and HTTPS traffic between clients and servers. This tool is particularly useful for debugging, testing, and security analysis of web applications and APIs.

## Key Features

- **HTTP/HTTPS Interception**: Seamlessly intercepts both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- **TLS Certificate Generation**: Dynamically generates TLS certificates for HTTPS connections
- **Rule-Based Modification**: Powerful rule system to conditionally modify requests and responses
- **Scriptable Actions**: Supports custom Go scripts for complex traffic manipulation
- **WebSocket Support**: Handles WebSocket connections
- **Environment Variable Support**: Rules can incorporate environment variables

## Architecture

The MITM Proxy consists of several key components:

1. **Proxy Server**: Handles incoming connections and routes traffic
2. **SSL Handler**: Manages TLS connections and certificate generation
3. **Rule Engine**: Processes and applies rules to modify traffic
4. **Rule Compiler**: Compiles rule definitions from YAML files

## Use Cases

- Debugging web applications by inspecting traffic
- Testing API integrations by modifying requests and responses
- Security testing by analyzing encrypted traffic
- Development of web applications by simulating backend responses
- Performance testing by introducing delays or modifying response sizes
